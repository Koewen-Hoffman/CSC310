A few things about this assignment:
- I had many issues with makefile im not sure how to diagnose. Whcn compiling,
I would get errors that classes from bstP.h were missing or not compile correctly.
So, to kake compiling easier, I had used a windows batch file (make.bat) to compile my program.

The screenshots are in here, screen_1 shows exceptions, and screen_2 shows every other implementation
I wrote on screen_2 to point everything out.
